as.data.frame.phate     Convert a PHATE object to a data.frame
as.matrix.phate         Convert a PHATE object to a matrix
check_pyphate_version   Check that the current PHATE version in Python
                        is up to date.
cluster_phate           KMeans on the PHATE potential Clustering on the
                        PHATE operator as introduced in Moon et al.
                        This is similar to spectral clustering.
ggplot.phate            Convert a PHATE object to a data.frame for
                        ggplot
install.phate           Install PHATE Python Package
library.size.normalize
                        Performs L1 normalization on input data such
                        that the sum of expression values for each cell
                        sums to 1, then returns normalized matrix to
                        the metric space using median UMI count per
                        cell effectively scaling all cells as if they
                        were sampled evenly.
phate                   Run PHATE on an input data matrix
plot.phate              Plot a PHATE object in base R
print.phate             Print a PHATE object
summary.phate           Summarize a PHATE object
tree.data               Fake branching data for examples
tree.data.small         Fake branching data for running examples fast
